# discord_craigslist_web_scape
Using Craigslist Listings to have an automated update system for new houses.

Uses pandas (csv editing), sellinium (driver, allows for scaping with a dynamically loaded website such as github), and discord.py (as a method of sending updates to a group of people) as tools to build a script that when ran, identifies new listings (relative to the last time the script was ran locally) and sends them on discord.
